H: Steve Clemons called me last night to talk about this, which he's just posted on his website. Ed Luce of the FT of
course told him. Also, Clemons had dinner this week with Petraeus, who freely talked about running for president. Sid
John Podesta on Obama team. I am hearing that Financial Times Washington Bureau Chief Edward Luca has a pretty
significant interview with Center for American Progress President and former White House Chief of Staff Jahn ?od.esta
coming out on Monday. Luce recently did a video intervjew 'with Senator john,Mc
fCain. One source tells me that Podesta
"goes farther" in his critique of the Obama team than his already pretty direct comments in Luce's recent survey of the
Obama White House's inner workings.

Dear Ms. Mills:
It may be inappropriate for me to do this and if so I apologize in advance but I thought Secretary Clinton might want to
know, and probably didn't, about terminal illness. My understanding is that the Clintons' and
paths crossed in Arkansas politics in the past and in a friendly way.
I know all of this because I am originally from Little Rock, and have been told of
friend who teaches at UALR and knows Additionally,
the state legislature for a decade or so, was my undergraduate advisor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock in the
1960s.
I am emailing you in your capacity as the Secretary's chief of staff.
Again, my apologies if this is something I shouldn't have done.
Sincerely,
John M. Carland

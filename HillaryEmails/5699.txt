\I told him that I would

disclose that you had already done so).

OK, will do. Please let me know results of Ashton call as this will be helpful to know in my calls with other EU FMs.

I asked State Ops to call Moratinos; they said you had previously asked and they wanted to know which order to call. Do you want to
call him first or do you want me to call and report to you and then you call?

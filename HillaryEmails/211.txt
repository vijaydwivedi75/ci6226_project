Post reports that Libyans police have arrested several people today who may/may have some connection to
the Benghazi attack. They were acting on information furnished by DS/R50.
That may or
may not materialize, according to David McFarland. Overall,
this could lead to something operationally, or not, and it could lead to news accounts from Libya saying, there
is a significant break in the case, or not.

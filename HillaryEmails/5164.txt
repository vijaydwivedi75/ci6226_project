Global Opinion in Perspective
Western Europe: Publics Credit U.S. for Relief to Haiti
Britons, French, Germans, Italians, and Spaniards say the United States has done more
than other countries to assist Haiti following the devastating January earthquake.
Though relief efforts in Haiti have not themselves directly impacted opinion of the
United States, the belief that the United States generally assists disaster-stricken
countries does positively affect US. image.
Awareness of Haiti relief efforts is high in
Europe: majorities of Britons (66%), French
(92%), Germans (85%), Italians (85%), and
Spaniards (70%) have heard at least a fair
amount about the earthquake and relief effort
in Haiti.
U.S. Credited For Relief Effort
Though certain West European media,
particularly in France and in Italy, were
initially critical of the U.S. relief effort,
editorials in leading media gave way to
mostly positive commentary. Public opinion
among those who have heard about the Haiti
earthquake reflects this more positive take.
West Europeans with a definite opinion
volunteer the United States as contributing the
most to earthquake relief in Haiti, though a
third or more in Britain, Spain, and Germany
are unsure (Figure 1).
Few in these five countries say their own
country contributed the most to earthquake
relief. In France, where early editorials were
most critical of the U.S., only a quarter say
that their country has done the most to aid
Haitian relief (Box, next page).
Among those who followed events in Haiti,
majorities believe that the United States has
done a good job in continuing to help Haitians
after the earthquake. Western European
publics also give their own countries and the
Red Cross high marks for responding (see
Appendix Table).
Haiti Aid Has Not Boosted U.S. Image
West Europeans remain generally positive
toward the U.S. (Figure 2, next page), but
their overall impressions are not significantly
influenced by U.S. assistance to Haiti.

Methodological Note: This report is based on surveys commissioned by the Office of Opinion Research.
Between April 19 and May 5, 2010, reputable firms interviewed 1,000 adults in each country (Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, and Spain). See page 3 for further details. M-70-10

FOR OFFICIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT USE ONLY
While specific instances of Haiti relief may
not move the needle of U.S. image in Western
Europe, a broader perception that the United
States provides disaster relief in general is a
factor in more favorable views. Majorities in
Great Britain (77%), Italy (79%), Germany
(86%), and France (72%) and half of
Spaniards (52%) think the United States aids
in disaster relief around the world. West
Europeans who perceive the U.S. as generous
with its disaster aid are more likely to have a
positive view of the U.S.
European Publics Satisfied with Their Own
Country's Level of Aid
Among those aware of the Haiti earthquake,
most are satisfied with their country's
contributions to the earthquake relief effort in
Haiti, but would be open to some additional
financial assistance for the reconstruction
effort. When asked if their government
should contribute more money to Haiti,
majorities in France (80%), Spain (74%), and
Italy (60%) and half of Britons (53%) agree.
French Generous With Help for Haiti,
Praise for U.S.
The French stand out in Europe in terms of
being concerned and willing to help their
former colony. An overwhelming majority
(92%) have heard or read about the earthquake
and the relief effort, including 65 percent who
have heard a great deal. Large majorities also
show a willingness to give more assistance
funds and take in refugees. A majority (63%)
recognizes the United States as the prime
contributor to the relief effort and 80 percent
say Washington has done a good job.
Helping refugees by allowing them to
immigrate is much more controversial.
Seven-in-ten French (72%) and Spanish
(73%) say they would be willing to accept
refugees, while majorities in Britain (63%)
and Italy (71%) are unwilling to accept
refugees.

How This Poll Was Conducted
This report is based on data from nationally representative telephone surveys conducted in Britain (n=1,002) April
21-26; France (n=1,002) April 19-23; Germany (n=1,000) April 23-May3; Italy (n=1,000) April 22-27; and Spain
(n=1,000) April 26-May5 among adults age 18 and over. Local survey organizations carried out nationwide
fieldwork. Questions were written by the Office of Opinion Research. The vernacular translations were prepared
by the local firms and checked by the Office of Opinion Research. The margin of error for each country is
approximately +/-4% for the overall sample.
Additional information on the methodology of the surveys may be obtained from the analysts.

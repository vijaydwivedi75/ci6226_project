We will draft a response and get it to you. We are also compiling other commentary -- most of which has been very
favorable. In a series of meetings we have had with the democracy and human rights groups, the response has been
overwhelmingly positive.

I thought the argument they made yesterday about the human rights speech was either deliberately obtuse or clueless.
Either way, we need to respond and refute. Can you have a response drafted and sent to me? Also, I'd like to see a
summary of points made by other commentary. Thx.

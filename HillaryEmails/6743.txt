Pakistan's Roller-Coaster Economy:
Tax Evasion Stifles Growth
S AKBAR ZAIDI
Visiting Scholar, South Asia Program
SUMMARY
Over the last sixty years, Pakistan's economy has seen severe ups and downs. Once considered a model for
other developing nations, Pakistan has been unable to sustain solid growth. Furthermore, a third of its
population now lives below the poverty line, and its literacy rate is abysmally low.
Pakistan's economic instability stems in large part from low government revenue resulting from the elite's
use of tax evasions, loopholes, and exemptions. Fewer than three million of Pakistan's 175 million citizens pay
any income taxes, and the country's tax-to-GDP ratio is only 9 percent. Tax evasion means fewer resources are
available for essential social services.
Pakistan spends too much on defense and too little on development: It has spent twice as much on defense
during peacetime as it has on education and health combined.
The government knows how to increase its revenue through tax reform, but the rich and powerful have
resisted such measures for fear of lowering their own incomes.
Without sufficient revenue the government will continue to be burdened with an unsustainable debt. It needs
to end tax exemptions for the wealthy and develop broader, long-term economic plans for sustainable growth.
In the past, the United States and other Western nations have come to Pakistan's rescue by paying off debts
and funding development initiatives. Pakistan's elite has no reason to support reform as long as these bailouts
come with no conditions attached.

Once heralded as a beacon for other develop-
ing countries, Pakistan's economy bears little
worthy of emulation today. For years now,
it has fluctuated wildly between periods of
impressive growth and dismal slumps. While
political competition between the mili-
tary and civilian politicians has been partly
responsible for this instability, Pakistan's lack
of a proper tax and revenue regime has result-
ed in high rates of tax evasion, burdening the
country with unsustainable debt and under-
mining its development priorities. Pakistan's
politics may recently have taken a turn for
the better with the strengthening of demo-
cratic institutions and the judiciary, but the
key to the country's economic prosperity—
even its survival—is a far-reaching program
of tax reform.
A TOPSY-TURVY PAST
On January 18, 1965 the New York Times
wrote: "Pakistan may be on its way toward"
economic success "that so far has been
reached by only one other populous country,
the United States." A year later the London
Times struck a similar enthusiastic note,
saying that "the survival and development
of Pakistan is one of the most remarkable
examples of state and nation building in the
post-war period."
Forty years later, the press was offering
a very different bouquet of sobriquets to
describe Pakistan. International newspapers
and magazines called it "the most danger-
ous place in the world," a "failed state," and a
‘`rogue state with a nuclear arsenal," to name
just a few. Only a few decades before, several
far less developed countries, such as South
Korea, Malaysia, China and India, were con-
sidered far less likely than Pakistan to survive,
much less thrive. Today, all of those countries
and others have surged ahead of Pakistan
economically.
Pakistan didn't fall behind because it
stood still; rather, its economic history spans
six decades of roller coaster ups and downs.
The first decade, 1947-1958, was one of
"settling down," in which the new country
comprising East and West Pakistan emerged
from British India. The second period,
1958-1968, was marked by the rule of
General Muhammad Ayub Khan and is now
known as the Decade of Development for its
high growth rates. Accompanying those high
growth rates, however, were high income and
regional inequality, which contributed to the

secession of East Pakistan and the war that
gave birth to Bangladesh.
In 1971 a new Pakistan emerged under
the government of the left-of-center Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto. Nationalization of private busi-
nesses and public sector—led development
were the norm for the new regime. Growth
was relatively low compared to the decades
before and after, but adequate under the
dire and constrained circumstances of the
time. Following Bhutto's ouster in 1977,
General Muhammad Zia ul-Haq inaugurated
Pakistan's fourth "era," ruling until 1988. Zia's
era saw the return of high growth rates, but
it also saw the role of the military increase
greatly in the economy, politics, foreign pol-
icy and in society more generally. Zia's death
brought a period of active civilian politics and
electioneering. "Democracy" is perhaps too
generous a term for this process. There were

PAKISTAN'S ROLLER-COASTER ECONOMY: TAX EVASION STIFLES GROWTH
numerous governments between 1988 and
1999, and economic performance nosedived
as it never had before. From October 1999
until to 2008, Pakistan was ruled by its third
military dictator, General Pervez Musharraf.
Pakistan's economy grew again during this
period, thanks to debt restructuring and large
doses of aid and assistance. Several factors
gave rise to these benevolent circumstances,
the most important of which was the inter-
national political atmosphere following 9/11.
Since 2008, a democratically elected coalition
government has been forced to deal with the
collateral damage caused by its predecessor's
politics and economics.
Despite the rise-and-fall pattern of GDP
growth over the last fifty years, Pakistan's econ-
omy has grown on average by more than 5 per-
cent per year. This is no mean achievement.
While many comparable countries in the region
have also grown at similar or higher rates,
Pakistan has the unenviable distinction of
inconsistent growth. Other countries such as
Malaysia, South Korea and, of course, China
have all had much higher growth rates over the
same period, and they generally have been able
to sustain those rates over decades. India too,
which had a far slower growth rate than
Pakistan's from about 1947 to the 1980s, has
not only improved its performance fundamen-
tally over the last twenty years, but has also
grown consistently for the past two decades,
leaving Pakistan far behind. Even Bangladesh,
once dismissed as a "basket case" by arrogant
Pakistani economists and planners, has recently
had several years of stable growth despite politi-
cal uncertainty. What distinguishes Pakistan
from these other countries is its inability to sus-
tain good performance for more than five or
six years. While India, China, Malaysia,
Vietnam, and numerous other countries east of
Pakistan have now emerged as regional and
global economic and political powerhouses,
Pakistan has barely stumbled along.
EXPLAINING THE
UP-AND-DOWN PATTERN
Is Pakistan and its economy forever doomed
to instability and stuttering growth? Why has
Pakistan's economy been so troubled? Does it
have deep rooted structural features that make
it peculiarly susceptible to crises?
A major explanation of Pakistan's volatile
economic history is the state's poor revenue
generation. Low tax revenues are in turn
caused by tax evasion and a legal structure
that allows for too many exemptions and
loopholes. Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio is just
The key to Pakistanis economic prosperity

of tax reform.
9 percent. This figure puts Pakistan in the
155th position out of 179 nations on the
Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic
Freedom. Only oil-rich countries that impose
few taxes perform worse. Fewer than three
million of Pakistan's population of 175 mil-
lion pay any income tax. A huge and buoyant
informal (underground) economy, estimated
to be anywhere from 30 to 80 percent of the
real economy, goes untaxed and unrecorded.
These are the attributes of a rentier state,
except that Pakistan lacks the wealth-produc-
ing oil and gas reserves normally associated
with such states.
Clearly, tax evasion and the inability of the
regime to tax the informal sector mean that
it has fewer resources for education, health,
infrastructure and development. A perennial
debt crisis has affected Pakistan's economy
largely because its expenditures, many of
which are justified, are well in excess of rev-
enue, forcing the country to go to foreign (and
domestic) borrowers. This indebtedness affects
issues of political economy at the domestic
and international level.

For example, the severe debt burden had
been the single most important attribute of
Pakistan's economy through the 1990s. Overall
outstanding debt was equal to GDP, and for-
eign debt servicing alone in 2001-2002 was
as much as 10 percent of GDP. Excessive tax
evasion was the primary cause of this.
After 9/11, however, the Musharraf regime
was able to sign agreements with bilateral and
multinational donors to write off or resched-
ule huge amounts of this debt, giving them
unprecedented fiscal space. This fiscal free-
dom was the main reason the economy turned
around so sharply. Growth rose to 7.5 percent
in 2003-2004 until maxing out the follow-
ing year at 9 percent, the highest level in two
decades. The fiscal deficit was near its lowest
level in almost two decades, remittances were at
historic highs, and exports crossed the $17 bil-
lion mark for the first time and showed signs of
further growth. By 2006-2007, domestic debt
had fallen to 30 percent of GDP, and foreign
debt servicing was less than 5 percent of GDP.
The government claimed that the economy
had rebounded, that there had been a "turn-
around," and that good times of high growth
and high human development had returned.
Even the stock market soared to unprecedented
levels, shattering records weekly.
Moreover, at some point between 2002
and 2004, Pakistan joined those ninety
or so countries that the United Nations
Development Programme's (UNDP) Human
Development Report (HDR) puts in the cat-
egory of "Medium Human Development."
From the time of the first annual HDR in
1990, Pakistan had consistently been classi-
fied as one of the forty or so countries in the
"Low Human Development" category. (By
comparison, both India and Bangladesh both

moved from the low to the medium category
in the late 1990s, well before Pakistan.) Many
thought that, after years of bei% considered
a "middle income country with low human
development," Pakistan had at last moved into
a category that better reflected its economic
and social characteristics.
Following the 2002-2007 period, Pakistan
seemed set on a course for sustained economic
improvement. Yet despite exceptional and
unanimous support from the international
donor community, little political opposition
at home, and uninterrupted political stability
and control of government (in sharp contrast
to the eleven changes of government between
1985-1999), these few years of remarkable
growth quickly unraveled.
REASONS FOR
UNRAVELING GROWTH
ABSENCE OF LONG-TERM
PLANNING AND INVESTMENT
The boom of the Musharraf years unraveled so
quickly because it was built on false founda-
tions: largely, consumer-led growth and invest-
ments in the speculative sector (real estate and
the stock market) fueled by remittances and
foreign aid. What was missing was a longer-
term strategy to guide the money being sent to
Pakistan into more productive sectors. Banks
awash with excess liquidity were all too eager
to feed the growing middle class with cheap
loans to finance their consumption. This
consumer-led boom did prompt the manufac-
turing sector to ramp up production to meet
increasing demand for cars, motorcycles and
other items, but it also helped create a bubble,
which eventually burst.
The budgetary maneuvering space created
by aid and debt write-offs did enable the gov-
ernment to spend money on much needed
infrastructure. The resulting new roads and
communication networks helped Pakistan,
although they couldn't keep up with the
increase in demand. The extent of the consumer
boom had caught the government off guard,
leaving them unable to provide the resources
that the growing middle class required. The
government's inability to meet the huge spurt
in demand for electric power, for example,
resulted in extensive power shortages which
have hurt manufacturing and industry.
THE ROUNDABOUT OF POLITICS
The governments of Generals Ayub (1958-
1968), Zia (1977-1988), and Musharraf
(1999-2008) were all, by definition, authori-
tarian military dictatorships, though each had
its own particular hue. Western powers sup-
ported all three of them, but for very different
reasons. All three were relatively benign com-
pared to the ruthless Latin American dictator-
ships of the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s.
One could, moreover, say that Musharraf's
rule was "softer" than the first two military
dictatorships, with the former even being
forced to follow the Constitution on numer-
ous occasions. Nevertheless, the absence of
political participation by the major parties
marked all three regimes.
A key factor separating Pakistan's military
dictatorships from those of Africa or Latin
America is their relatively short life spans.
None of them managed to successfully pass off
the baton to a military successor. Once politi-
cal pressure began to emerge, the Ayub and
Musharraf regimes crumbled (Zia was killed
in a plane crash) because they excluded key
civilian political actors.
While India, China, Malaysia, Vietnam, and
numerous other countries east of Pakistan
have now emerged as regional and global
economic and political powerhouses,
Pakistan has barely stumbled along.

When civilians regained power, they tended
to blame the military for Pakistan's problems,
regardless of whether such blame was justi-
fied. The threat of yet another military coup
hung over these civilian governments, weak-
ening them and thus creating the rationale for
the military to intervene. The extremely short
tenures of Pakistan's elected governments left
them no opportunities to craft long-term
strategies.
The experiences of Pakistan's neighbor
India provide an important point of compari-
son here. The Indian electorate rejected the
"India shining" slogans of the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP)—led government of 1999-2004
in favor of a Congress-led government. Yet
despite the intense antagonism between the
Congress Party and the BJP, the political tran-
sition was a smooth one. Of course, India is a
mature democracy whereas Pakistan's has had
little opportunity to grow, but the example
nevertheless shows that smooth political tran-
sitions and high growth rates are not entirely
foreign to the region.
Pakistan's frequent regime changes aren't
the only reason that the country has never
been able to engage in long-term planning. It
is also possible that the system itself, regardless
of whether civilians or the military are at the
helm, encourages the rentier mentality. Recent
events related to profiteers hoarding wheat
and sugar, for example, suggest that corrup-
tion continues to enjoy support from key
elements of Pakistan's society. Such systemic
Pakistan'o' poky makers and polliticians
need to understand that they cannot go
on Iliviing on b rrowed money forever.

PAKISTAN'S ROLLER-COASTER ECONOMY: TAX EVASION STIFLES GROWTH
corruption severely distorts the signaling func-
tions of markets, and thus efficient develop-
ment as well.
LOW EMPHASIS ON HUMAN CAPITAL
One of the paradoxes of Pakistan's economy
is its periodic achievement of high rates of
growth despite being burdened with poor
social indicators. Pakistan's economic and
social profile from 1993 to 2003 looked more
like that of an African country, combining an
abysmally low literacy rate with a skyrocketing
population, poor treatment of women, and
endemic poverty. Economic growth has done
little to ameliorate Pakistan's social problems.
One reason why investment in human
capital has been so low is that defense expen-
diture has been so high. In peacetime, military
expenditure has exceeded 7 percent of GDP,
twice the amount allocated to education
and health combined. With debt service and
defense taking up as much as 75 percent of
the government's annual budget throughout
the 1980s and 1990s, very little remained for
development.
In the age of globalization, such failure to
invest in human capital bodes ill for Pakistan's
future. While Pakistan's neighbor India, by
contrast, has successfully diversified into ser-
vices such as information technology, Pakistan
has failed to do so, despite sharing one of
India's biggest advantages: a large English-
speaking population.
One of the fundamental reasons Pakistan's
elite has failed to invest in human capital is its
lack of appreciation for the idea of the public
good. Short-term, narrow and selfish interests,
whether class-, institution- or ethnic-based,
override the common good. It's hard to under-
stand why this behavior persists, and hence
even more difficult to "solve" the problems it
creates, but at least recognizing it is the first
step toward a solution.
TAX EVASION—THE CORE ISSUE?
There are at least two sides to Pakistan's overin-
vestment in defense (and thus its underinvest-
ment in development). On the demand side,
defense overinvestment derives from the per-
Pakistan's lack of a proper tax and revenue
regime has resulted in high rates of tax
e asion, burdening the country with
unsustainable debt and undermining its
development priorities.
ception that "national insecurity" is a defining
feature of the Pakistani state. This is both a
cause and an effect of the military's dominance
of the country's political economy. But there
is a supply side to this issue, too. Essentially,
if government revenues were higher, Pakistan
might be able to fund both defense and devel-
opment at a level more conducive to national
well-being. The question remains: Why aren't
government revenues higher?
The main culprit is tax evasion. Pakistan's
tax evasion problem is caused by three things:
poor legal frameworks and bureaucratic capa-
bilities with regard to revenue extraction; cor-
ruption in the form of a predatory class that
privileges certain sectors and vested interests
with unjustified tax "exemptions"; and elites
who cut deals with the state to avoid taxa-
tion, made possible by an anemic agriculture
income tax (agriculture makes up 22 per-
cent of Pakistan's GDP, but only 1 percent
of its tax revenue). Research suggests that
with a more extensive, transparent, progres-
sive and equitable tax structure, government
revenue could easily double, thus closing the
huge gap between defense and development
expenditures.
The fact that Pakistan—the world's 26th
richest country in purchasing power parity—

does so poorly when it comes to revenue gen-
eration suggests that deep structural factors are
at work. A small elite comprised of the mili-
tary, land owners, and the rising urban upper
and middle classes, is loath to give up any of
its wealth (some of which is illegally accumu-
lated). Even the apparently forward-looking,
enlightened, and modernist military regime
headed by General Pervez Musharraf failed to
restructure Pakistan's tax regime, and backed
down in the face of a massive popular revolt to
his proposal to register traders and shop own-
ers. It's unlikely that an elected government
will do any better. Given their typically short
political tenures, elected governments are too
fearful of daggers in the night to propose bold,
politically unpopular solutions. And despite
their loud protestations to the contrary, oppo-
sition parties would be no more likely to
champion reform if they came into power.
Thus it isn't that the military and civilian
elite of Pakistan don't know how to fix the
problem; it's that their short-sightedness and
penchant for self-preservation make them not
want to. Their certain knowledge that "the
West will never let Pakistan fail" also gives the
elite tremendous confidence in the status quo.
CONCLUSIONS
Is there anything that can be done? Is Pakistan's
economy fated to hover perpetually near the
edge of crisis? Perhaps not. Some positive
trends suggest that some of Pakistan's liabili-
ties may be receding. One must keep in mind,
of course, that predicting Pakistan's economic
and political future is a game whose rules are
extremely uncertain.
Despite the uncertainties, two observa-
tions about the post-Musharraf period stand
out. First, while Pakistan's economic growth
rate dipped considerably in 2008-2009 to
1.2 percent, it rebounded to about 4 percent
the following year. This figure, although still
low compared to earlier years, is respectable
in a time of increasing internal terrorism and
global slowdown, and it suggests that even in
difficult times, economic growth is possible in
Pakistan. It may also suggest that the under-
lying structures in the economy have shifted
much as they did two decades ago. In sharp
contrast to its dismal performance in the
1990s and the period after Pakistan's nuclear
tests in 1998, Pakistan's economy may have
ascended to a higher, more stable plane. If
Pakistan can perform so well when the rest of
the world is reeling from a global recession,
then a more forceful economic policy might
produce truly exceptional results.
The second observation concerns the
maturing of the political process, which sug-
gests the possibility of greater continuity, a key
requirement for economic stability. Despite
numerous attacks, challenges and tensions
from within, Pakistan's democracy has man-
aged to weather the past two-and-a-half years
fairly comfortably—so far. An assertive judi-
ciary, a supportive civilian opposition and
a reticent, contemplative military have all
helped to strengthen and deepen the political
process of democracy.
Ever mindful of uncertainties, and keep-
ing these two observations in mind, it is clear
that the government will have to make several

decisions to break out of the high-low cycle
and place the economy on a more stable foot-
ing. First, it must undertake a comprehensive
revision of the tax regime if it is ever to seri-
ously tackle development, particularly in the
social sectors. This can only happen if there
is a political consensus to tax the rich. Given
that many of the rich are elected policy mak-
ers, this means that the elite will have to look
past their strong, vested interests in the status
quo. Forging such a consensus will require
not just technocratic innovations but politi-
cal settlements in which members of the civil-
ian, political and military elites come to some
form of agreement on a long-term strategy for
Pakistan's political and economic future. The
international community has a role to play,
too. Multilateral agencies, the United States,
and other countries must carefully reconsider
their aid and loan packages to avoid creating a
moral hazard. If large amounts of foreign assis-
tance are always at hand when Pakistan nears a
crisis, then Pakistan's elite will have no incen-
tive to look past the short term.
POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
o Pakistani policy makers and politicians need
to understand that they cannot go on living
on borrowed money forever. They must
build a partisan consensus to tax the rich
and the elite (mostly themselves) if they
wish to• bring Pakistan up to speed with
other developing countries in the region.
O They must eliminate unjustifiable tax
exemptions and preferences given to sec-
tors or individuals, and institute in its place
a broader policy that taxes earnings and
wealth, not activities.
O Pakistan must improve documentation of
the economy in order to better estimate
taxable income and increase government
revenue.
O Pakistan's leadership needs to rise above
party politics and, with the advice and con-
sent of a supportive opposition, implement
a broader economic framework.
O Donor countries need to recognize that
they have bailed out Pakistan too often.
They should instead pursue a "do more"
approach, emphasizing tax and economic
policies that can harness Pakistan's huge
underreported revenue potential.

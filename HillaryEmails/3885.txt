Re: Redesign of State.gov Accomplishments and Changes
On Thursday, December 17, 2009 the Department launched a new homepage design and altered navigation
functionality for www.state.gov,the public facing site of the State Department.
The site aimed to meet the following goals:
• Better highlight the Department's priorities
• Proactively engage visitors
• Develop more Search-friendly features
• Provide easy access to vital citizen services, e.g. passport and visa information
The launch brought a series of positive press as noted in the below clips:
"..it embraces social networking and other Web 2.0 tools in an exercise it called "21st Century statecraft." — AFP
Global
"Gone are the old pro forma website verticals like press information, career postings, and resources for kids and other
young one. Now, State.gov's site navigation draws attention to the ambitious policy thrusts that Secretary Clinton
would like to make the centerpieces of her tenure at the department." — TechPresident
"The State Department hopes to use the site to engage people in an ongoing dialogue on foreign policy" -- Federal
Computer Week
"The U.S. Department of State today unveiled a redesign of its official website, incorporating improved functionality
and an updated design. With significant increases in traffic and expanding needs among users, the new, simplified
design of www.state.gov aims to: present the Department of State more transparently, effectively communicate the

overarching mission of the Department of State, and increasingly engage audiences in an ongoing dialogue with
Secretary Clinton and others in the Department on the foreign policy issues facing the country." — Enews Channel
Results:
Overall the site has received positive praise from inside and outside the building on the new simplified design. The
increased focus on major foreign policy objectives and on social networking have altered traffic and increased our
networks. The new design allows us to better educate visiting audiences on the priorities of the Department and better
engage in a daily conversation.
All metrics are trending up for visiting audiences to state.gov, Dipnote the blog, and social networking.
Top Line Statistics:
State.gov: 37% increase in traffic
Dipnote Blog: 30% increase to traffic
Facebook: 20% increase to number of fans
Twitter: 23% increase to number of followers
Search: -3% indicating that users perhaps are better at finding information and have less of a need for search function.
We will continue to monitor.
Going forward:
We will continue to monitor all our metrics to ensure we are expanding our reach and engagement. We will look in the
coming year to continue refining the website to build upon initial successes to ensure information is easy to find,
understandable and useable. We will also look to build more language support into State.gov, and increase the number
of social networking tools we are using to engage visiting audiences.
Also given the increased importance on interagency priorities like Global Health and Food Security, we will seek ways
that we can work together across agencies to promote our agenda and educate each of our visiting audiences on
priorities through www.state.gov.

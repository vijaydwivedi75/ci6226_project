HRON1C DISEASES ARE THE
largest cause of death in the
world (FIGURE 1), led by car-
diovascular disease (17 mil-
lion deaths in 2002, mainly from is-
chemic heart disease and stroke) and
followed by cancer (7 million deaths),
chronic lung diseases (4 million), and
diabetes mellitus (almost 1 million).'
These leading diseases share key risk
factors: tobacco use, unhealthful di-
ets, lack of physical activity, and alco-
hol use (TABLE)." The current burden
of chronic diseases reflects past expo-
sure to these risk factors, and the fu-
ture burden will be largely deter-
mined by current exposures.
The global prevalence of all the lead-
ing chronic diseases is increasing, with
the majority occurring in developing
countries and projected to increase sub-
stantially over the next 2 decades (Fig-
ure 1).3 Cardiovascular disease is al-
ready the leading cause of mortality in
developing countries (FIGURE 2).1 Be-
tween 1990 and 2020, mortality from is-
chemic heart disease in developing coun-
tries is expected to increase by 120% for
women and 137% for men.' Predic-
tions for the next 2 decades include a
. near tripling of ischemic heart disease
and stroke mortality in Latin America,
the Middle East, and sub-Saharan Africa.
The global number of individuals with
diabetes in 2000 was estimated to be 171
million (2.8% of the world's population),
a figure projected to increase in 2030 to
366 million (6.5%), 298 million of whom
Chronic diseases are the largest cause of death in the world. In 2002, the
leading chronic diseases—cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respira-
tory disease, and diabetes—caused 29 million deaths worldwide. Despite
growing evidence of epidemiological and economic impact, the global re-
sponse to the problem remains inadequate. Stakeholders include govern-
ments, the World Health Organization and other United Nations bodies, aca-
demic and research groups, nongovernmental organizations, and the private
sector. Lack of financial support retards capacity development for preven-
tion, treatment, and research in most developing countries. Reasons for this
include that up-to-date evidence related to the nature of the burden of chronic
diseases is not in the hands of decision makers and strong beliefs persist
that chronic diseases afflict only the affluent and the elderly, that they arise
solely from freely acquired risks, and that their control is ineffective and too
expensive and should wait until infectious diseases are addressed. The in-
fluence of global economic factors on chronic disease risks impedes progress,
as does the orientation of health systems toward acute care. We identify 3
policy levers to address these impediments: elevating chronic diseases on
the health agenda of key policymakers, providing them with better evi-
dence about risk factor control, and persuading them of the need for health
systems change. A more concerted, strategic, and multisectoral policy ap-
proach, underpinned by solid research, is essential to help reverse the nega-
tive trends in the global incidence of chronic disease.

Chronic diseases have not simply dis-
placed acute infectious ones in devel-
oping countries. Rather, such coun-
tries now experience a polarized and
protracted double burden of disease."
India, the second most populous coun-
try, has the highest number of diabet-
ics in the world and annual coronary
deaths are expected to reach 2 million
by 2010.12 At the same time, around 2.5
million children in India die from in-
fections such as pneumonia, diarrhea,
and malaria every year. In South Africa,
infectious diseases account for 28% of
years of lives lost while chronic dis-
eases account for 25%."
The increased burden of chronic dis-
eases in countries that also have a high
infectious disease burden is straining
their health services. In all countries,
it is also leading to growing economic
costs, best documented with respect to
tobacco-related diseases,8 with increas-
ing evidence emerging for cardiovas-
cular disease,' diabetes," and obe-
sity." Many developed nations have
focused considerable efforts on address-
ing the burden of chronic diseases. In
contrast, the rising burden of chronic
diseases on developing countries has re-
ceived inadequate attention."
The rates and potential risks of
chronic disease, vis-a-vis policy deci-
sions, can be described conceptually.
For example, as economic develop-
ment occurs, tobacco use and obesity
(and presumably other risk behav-
iors) increase.9." Eventually uptake of
risk factors leads to onset of disease.
Mortality and morbidity from chronic
disease subsequently decline along with
continued economic development.
Thus far, only the Organisation for Eco-
n o mic Co-operation and Develop-
ment countries have achieved these de-
clines,' which have been associated with
consumption behavior, while declin-
ing mortality from chronic diseases is
associated with very high levels of so-
cial and economic development. Thus,
in the absence of policy actions, con-
sumption of tobacco, alcohol, and foods
high in fat and sugar increases along
with gross national product, followed
by associated increases in chronic dis-

GLOBAL BURDEN OF CHRONIC DISEASES
til high levels of wealth and literacy are
reached, whereupon governments are
more likely to respond to public health
concerns and use a broad range of
policy instruments to influence con-
sumption trends. The global chal-
lenge policymakers face is how to
implement policies now that support
continued economic development while
simultaneously reducing the rates of in-
crease of chronic diseases.
KEY PLAYERS' POLICY
RESPONSES TO
THE GLOBAL BURDEN
OF CHRONIC DISEASES
Although many key groups have re-
sponded to the infectious disease bur-
dens of developing nations, they have
not responded to the expanded chronic
disease burden.
Heads of State
Heads of state of the G8 countries rec-
ognized health as a global challenge at
their Summit in 2000, acknowledging
that health is the "key to prosperity"
and that "poor health drives pov-
erty."" The G8 leaders agreed to

mobilize resources, ultimately leading
to the establishment of the Global
Fund for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and
Malaria.20 No subsequent commitment
has yet been made for chronic dis-
eases.
Similarly, the G77, representing heads
of state from approximately 130 devel-
oping countries, recently discussed global
health issues.2' Their focus was commu-
nicable diseases although they did sup-
port the Framework Convention on To-
bacco Control—a reversal for manyG77
members, who previously feared re-
duced tobacco consumption would nega-
tively affect their farmers."The G77have
also expressed concerns that efforts to re-
duce sugar consumption might harm
their economies!'
Health Ministries
The capacity of 185 countries to pre-
vent and treat chronic diseases was re-
cently assessed by the World Health Or-
ganization (WHO)." Although there was
a high level of awareness about chronic
diseases among health ministry offi-
cials, this was not supported by compre-
hensive policies and budgets to develop
integrated approaches to their preven-
tion, surveillance, and control. Thirty-
nine percent of countries reviewed had
budget lines for chronic diseases. Only
a few developing countries have com-
mitted significant resources to chronic
disease control."
World Health Organization
Many of WHO's functions are directly
related to chronic disease control. WHO
member states first requested action on
chronic diseases in 1956 when India pro-
posed a resolution on cardiovascular dis-
ease and hypertension at the Ninth World
Health Assembly." Subsequently, mem-
ber states from both developed and devel-
oping countries have demanded action
on chronic diseases, including the global
strategy on "Prevention and Control of
Non-communicable Diseases" in 2000°5
and a resolution and subsequent strat-
egy on "Diet, Physical Activity and
Health" in 2002-2004.2' The landmark
resolution on the Framework Conven-
tion on Tobacco Control in 20032' was
the first time WFIO used its constitu-
tional treaty-making right to address a
global public health threat.
With the important exception of to-
bacco control, WHO's financial re-
sources for chronic disease control are
small. WHO Headquarters spends only
$0.50 on chronic diseases (all noncom-
municable diseases except for mental
health) per death per person com-
pared with $7.50 for leading commu-
nicable diseases.28
Academic Health Centers
and Research Institutions
Schools of public health in the United
States train thousands of health profes-
sionals from developing countries who
return home as potential future public
health leaders. A survey of the core re-
quirements of the curricula of mem-
bers of the Association of Schools of Pub-
lic Health indicates that international
health course work does not yet reflect
the current global burden of chronic dis-
eases.29 Although Johns Hopkins, Uni-
versity of North Carolina, and Yale now
address obesity in their nutrition courses
and Yale teaches chronic diseases and has

GLOBAL BURDEN OF CHRONIC DISEASES
a international tobacco seminar in its in-
troductory global health course, the pri-
mary focus remains on infectious dis-
eases and primary health care.
International committees convened by
the Global Forum on Health Research
recommend that greater support be given
to chronic disease research specific to
developing countries." Yet the exponen-
tial growth of funding over the past
decades has not been proportionally allo-
cated to the growing burden of chronic
disease.31 Most research support focuses
on infectious diseases.3='" A recent review
showed that total health research funds
spent on chronic diseases was only 7.4%
in Cuba, 2.3% in Kazakhstan, and 14.4%
in the Philippines?'
Nevertheless, there are efforts to fo-
cus more research on chronic dis-
eases. The Fogarty International Cen-
ter has begun to allocate one third of
its resources to chronic disease re-
search and training programs in the de-
veloping world." Research funding
agencies in India, Mexico, and South
Africa are devoting increasing budget-
ary resources to chronic diseases."-"
Important insights into policies needed
to strengthen research capability for
chronic diseases in developing na-
tions can be gained from experiences
in tropical disease research and train-
ing over the past 3 decades."
Donors
Although official development assis-
tance for health has increased in the past
5 years, these trends have been almost
entirely absorbed by human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS in sub-
Saharan Africa (Catherine M. Michaud,
MD, PhD, written communication,
October 2003). Bilateral aid agencies
rarely prioritize chronic disease or
related risk factors.'" Official Overseas
Development Aid to the health sector
in 2002 reached $2.9 billion, of which
0.1% was officially allocated to chronic
diseases (including mental health;
Catherine M. Michaud, MD, PhD, writ-
ten communication, March 2004). The
true figure may be higher since about
30% of Overseas Development Aid to
health goes to basic health services, of
which a proportion would benefit
chronic disease control.
Private investment in global health far
exceeds government assistance, but most
target infectious diseases and humani-
tarian needs. There has been modest sup-
port for tobacco control from the UN
Foundation, the Rockefeller Founda-
tion, and the Soros Foundations,41.42 but
this is now declining. The Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation does not in-
clude chronic diseases in its portfolio."
Although several US foundations sup-
port innovative domestic chronic dis-
ease research and training programs, they
provide little support for such pro-
grams internationally.
World Bank and Regional
Development Banks
Although the World Bank recognizes
the increasing burden of chronic dis-
eases on the poor, it has no compre-
hensive chronic disease policy. Over the
last 5 years, it provided $4.25 billion
in loans to countries for health sector
work, about 2.5% of which was allo-
cated to "noncommunicable disease
prevention and control" programs, all
in eastern Europe (Catherine M. Mi-
chaud, MD, PhD, written communica-
tion, March 2004).
The lack of an integrated approach to
chronic diseases is reflected by the Bank's
Poverty Strategy Reduction Papers, which
are intended to guide investment priori-
ties to reduce poverty in the poorest
countries in the world. However, the Pov-
erty Strategy Reduction Papers present
no strategies to address chronic dis-
eases, and in particular smoking."
The Regional Development Banks
have policies on health, but only the
Asian Development Bank includes
chronic diseases."' This policy has been
met by minimal spending commit-
ments. A review carried out for the Asian
Development Bank in 1999 recom-
mends that subsidies for chronic dis-
eases would be better spent on the pre-
vention and treatment of communicable
diseases."' The rationale was that the cost
of treating chronic disease is most likely
to accrue to individuals and, as such,
should be left to the private market.
Global Nongovernmental
Organizations
Nationally, nongovernmental organi-
zations (NG0s) are reported to play a
variety of roles in chronic disease con-
trol, but their precise roles and effec-
tiveness are not well known.23 Inter-
nationally, NGOs proved critical in
the development of the Framework
Convention on Tobacco Control."
Nongovernmental organizations have
a wide geographic spread and have
the ability to build capacity. Yet over-
all, there has been no concerted effort
on chronic diseases by NG0s. Non-
governmental organizations con-
cerned with diet and nutrition in
developed countries have not built
capacity in developing countries.
International consumer group input is
inadequate. Initiatives such as "sus-
tainable development" and "corporate
social responsibility" have not been
applied to Chronic diseases.
Health and Development
Initiatives
United Nations health and develop-
ment reports play a major role in
setting priorities for global health. Per-
sistent problems that hinder develop-
ment, such as infant and maternal mor-
tality, malnutrition, and HIV/AIDS have
received priority in the poorest coun-
tries. But the emphasis on communi-
cable diseases has excluded consider-
ation of chronic diseases in low-
middle and middle income countries.
The Millennium Development Goals are
illustrative in this respect. Millen-
nium Development Goal 6 is to "Com-
bat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other dis-
eases."4 Although the other diseases
category theoretically includes chronic
diseases, in practice, they are ignored.
The UN Population Fund does not
mention chronic diseases in its strat-
egy on population and development"'
and UN Children's Fund's recent goal-
setting program, "A World Fit for Chil-
dren" does not include risk factors for
chronic conditions among the 25 ac-
tion points proposed to "promote
healthy lives" despite strong evidence
to the contrary."

GLOBAL BURDEN OF CHRONIC DISEASES
Reasons for Neglect: Impediments
to Control Global Chronic Diseases
In most developing countries inad-
equate financing and lack of man-
power to address chronic diseases have
been major impediments to chronic dis-
ease control. Other impediments are the
failure to provide key decision makers
with up-to-date evidence on the bur-
den of chronic diseases: a lack of un-
derstanding of the economic factors that
influence chronic disease risks; and the
current orientation of health systems to-
ward acute care.
Up-to-Date Evidence Is Not in the
Hands of Key Decision Makers
Many key decision makers still be-
lieve that chronic diseases afflict only
the affluent and the elderly and arise
only from freely acquired risks and that
their control is ineffective and too ex-
pensive and should wait until infec-
tious diseases are addressed.
These beliefs are based on a misun-
derstanding of the chronic disease bur-
den. In developed countries, the rela-
tionship between socioeconomic
inequalities and many chronic dis-
eases and their risk factors are well de-
scribed." Although the disease bur-
den is more variable in developing
countries, the poorest populations, par-
ticularly in rapidly growing cities, in
many cases already exhibit the high-
est risks for tobacco use, alcohol use,
and physical activity, with evidence
emerging for obesity.5254 This will lead
to a higher burden of chronic diseases
over the long-term. Poverty also leads
to greater comorbidity and decreased
access to quality medical care.
Chronic diseases in developing coun-
tries are not just diseases of the el-
derly, since cardiovascular disease ac-
counts for as many deaths in young and
middle-agerfadults as HIWAIDS.' Also,
in developing countries chronic dis-
eases affect a much higher proportion
of people during their prime working
years than in developed countries. Male
deaths during middle age could create
a significant cohort of widows, which
increases the likelihood that women will
live out their final years in poverty.'
Many decision makers mistakenly be-
lieve that chronic diseases arise only as
a result of the irresponsibility of the in-
dividuals who contract them, with the
perception that "smoking is a free choice
with health consequences."" Yet age and
uptake of smoking in developing coun-
tries are showing a trend toward early
teenage years,' the stage of life when the
addictiveness of tobacco belies free-
dom of choice. Tobacco marketing is of-
ten targeted specifically at children," al-
cohol advertisements shape young
peoples' perceptions and encourage pro-
drink attitudes," and food marketing
works its way "into the skin" of chil-
dren and adolescents." There will al-
ways be a tension between the role of in-
dividuals vs the role of government, but
it is clear that governments (and indus-
try) must take some responsibility."
Chronic disease control is not neces-
sarily expensive or ineffective. For ex-
ample, a recent review of tobacco con-
trol in Brazil, South Africa, Thailand,
Poland, Bangladesh, and Canada showed
that tobacco prevalence can be re-
duced cost-effectively in high-, middle-,
and low-income countries.' Several
clinical and public health interven-
tions have the potential to reduce the
burden of disease from cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, and hypertension sig-
nificantly and at low cost.' There is, how-
ever, an urgent need to develop best
practices for obesity control.
The belief that scarce resources should
not be used for chronic diseases until in-
fectious diseases are addressed is also fal-
lacious. Several infectious agents cause
cancer?; tobacco increases deaths from
tuberculosis in already infected popu-
lations,' and antiretroviral regimens in
HIV-infected patients increase the risk
of heart disease.' Better tobacco con-
trol would reduce tuberculosis mortal-
ity, and new vaccines could reduce the
prevalence of cervical cancer and per-
haps other cancers.
Economic Factors Influence
Chronic Disease Risks
At a macroeconomic level, it is often as-
sumed that global economic develop-
ment increases income and subse-
quently improves all aspects of health
in developing countries. Yet, although
greater economic investment and higher
incomes among some groups have
eased some of the health challenges in
developing countries, chronic dis-
eases have been exacerbated.'
Important drivers here are urbaniza-
tion, trade, foreign investment, and pro-
motional marketing. More open con-
ditions for trade and foreign investment
can bring economic benefits, but also
encourage unhealthful behavior risks."
Several of the world's top 100 nonfi-
nancial transnational corporations
ranked by foreign assets in 2000 are as-
sociated with chronic disease risk fac-
tors, including tobacco, food, and au-
tomobile companies.64 These companies
all invest heavily in marketing their
products,"'" which, if unregulated, en-
courages acquisition of the risk fac-
tors for chronic diseases.
Lobbyists for tobacco, sugar, and other
food interests have diverted attention
from the need to address consumption
patterns that drive chronic diseases, and
their views have become the accepted
position of many policytnakers." Some
companies and their trade associations
have actively tried to thwart introduc-
tion of regulations and effective advo-
cacy in advancing tobacco control."
Sugar lobbyists have been effective in
having their messages that "sugar doesn't
harm health—but less sugar consump-
tion harms their economies" accepted by
some governments despite evidence to
the contrary.67
Health Systems Are Not Oriented
Toward Managing Chronic
Diseases
Acute problems, such as certain infec-
tious diseases and maternal and child
care, have been the principal focus of
health care systems." Although infec-
tious diseases continue to be a threat
in many developing :countries, their
health systems now must address a
double burden of chronic and acute
conditions.
The chronic disease management
model is more complex than that re-
quired for acute problems, such as

many infectious diseases." It entails
multiple causes over a lifetime and a
more horizontal and integrated ap-
proach, with patient, family, and the
community being active participants.
Chronic care has tended to screen
high-risk individuals with a high prob-
ability of contracting chronic dis-
eases. Yet for chronic diseases, most risk
factors are widely distributed in the
population, with all individuals at risk
but differing in the extent of their risk.69
Prevention and treatment therefore re-
quires a sustained, multisectoral com-
mitment well beyond the traditional
health sector. This model is also re-
quired for communicable diseases such
as HIV/AIDS, since antiretroviral
therapy must be taken for life."
TOWARD THE
FUTURE-LEVERING
LONG-TERM CHANGE
The rising global burden of chronic dis-
eases needs stronger leadership by
policy makers, advocates, and health
professionals.
Placing Chronic Diseases Higher on
the Political and Health Agenda
Decision makers need to be fully in-
formed with the up-to-date evidence
about the burden and impacts of
chronic diseases. Clearer messages on
chronic diseases are needed and the ad-
vocacy base expanded. Gaps in our
knowledge about chronic disease con-
trol should be tackled using a "grand
challenges in i tiative."71
Controlling Risk Factors
for Chronic Diseases
The negative impacts of global eco-
nomic development can be amelio-
rated through multisectoral action to
tackle chronic diseases upstream. Policy
leaders need to encourage transna-
tional corporations to improve health
while also making a profit by putting
in place new business models, such as
those being developed by Unilever
(Paulus Verschuen and Harry jonge-
neelan, written communication, May
13,2004) and Novo Nordisk SA.7' They
should also encourage the creation of
codes and incentives for healthy for-
eign investment in developing coun-
tries and incorporating chronic dis-
eases into accountability initiatives such
as the UN Global Compact."
The role of government is critical to
the development and implementation
of well grounded risk-factor control
programs such as the WHO's Frame-
work Convention on Tobacco Con-
trol, which also has implications for
food policies." Age-specific death rates
from the leading chronic diseases in Or-
ganization for Economic Co-opera-
tion and Development countries have
declined as a result of governmental and
civil society action against tobacco use,
emphasis on maintaining healthful life
styles, and access to treatments.4 Over
the last decade, increased longevity has
been accompanied by a compression of
morbidity: in the United States, disabil-
ity rates in people older than 65 years
have decreased 2% a year while mor-
tality rates have declined by 1%."
Governments can play a role by alter-
ing economic incentives for business and
individuals. Expanding markets for fruit
and vegetables will allow developing
countries to gain from increased ex-
port earnings and consumption. Rais-
ing the tobacco excise tax to levels that
will reduce consumption effectively"
will increase government revenue and
reduce the burden of disease.
Health System Realignment
Health systems should be realigned to ac-
commodate diagnosis, secondary pre-
vention, and primary prevention of
chronic diseases. Governments need to
support this transformation if they are
to realize significant health gains. In an
approach that has international applica-
tions, the United Kingdom Govern-
ment Treasury has recommended a set
of clear health targets and objectives for
the nation based on scenarios." The new
financing opportunities for chronic in-
fectious diseases like H1V/AIDS and tu-
berculosis create a chance to build inte-
grated systems in the poorest countries.
The potential for secondary prevention
of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in
developing countries has been high-
lighted by several academics4.'668 but
needs to be translated into action.
We are now at a critical juncture with
respect to the global health agenda. Co-
ordinated and focused emphasis on
chronic disease is essential to address
the enormity of the burden of those who
now survive beyond childhood around
the world.

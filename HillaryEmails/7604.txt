Hi there,
Would you mind passing the below note onto HRC from Bono and Ali?
Many thanks
Catriona
Dearest Hillary,
Happy Birthday - we're sad to have missed the other night, but arrived late from the west coast.
We are in NY for a month... if you and Bill are upstate and have time for a catch up, let us know.
Love Bono & Ali

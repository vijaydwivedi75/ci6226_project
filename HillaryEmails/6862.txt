Dear Ms Mills,
My name is Steven Everts and I am responsible in the Private Office of HR/VP Ashton for EU-US relations (I was the one
handlig the very successful meeting in Washington that the Secretary had with the HR/VP on 21 Jan).
I now have a more personal issue: apparently the Secretary and the HR/VP spoke briefly in London

From our side, the email to use would be
I would be very grateful if you could send us an email which is similarly private.
Many thanks for your help.
Kind regards
Steven Everts
Private Office of HR/VP Catherine Ashton
